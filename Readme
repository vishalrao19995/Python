I have Started to learn python and decided to do 1 new different project everyday.

1.  Project 1 - Level Beginner  - Guessing game

   Goal:
   
   A random number will be generated from 0 to 20, the player has to guess the number. If the player is 5 units higher away from the number it
   signals RED and lower BLUE, while it is between 1-3 units away from the number it signals Warmer.
   
   The player has only 3 chances to guess. After which the game shows you the number that was to be guessed and asks if you want to
   play again
